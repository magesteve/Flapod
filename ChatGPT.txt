The following question was used to generate source files for Flapod:

Could you provide a Flutter app named "Flapod" that displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using the provided API key Vy7VIaEuCnDhsMTeVPRe9MJZgGuBfD73P7SMXLb2? The app should fetch and display the APOD image and include a button to open the APOD page in an external browser. If the photo of the day is a video, neither an image nor a video should appear; instead, the 2 lines of text "Video available” & “Click the View on NASA APOD button" (in red and centered) would appear above the day's information. If the data fails to load, the message "Unable to load image today" will appear in place of the normal days information (in red and centered).  Additionally, there should be an FAQ button in the AppBar that reads questions and answers from an FAQ.txt file located in the assets folder. If the file has an odd number of lines, the last line should be ignored. Lastly, a button called "View on NASA APOD" should appear at the bottom of the column, and it should use launchUrl with a mode parameter LaunchMode.externalApplication to open the APOD page in an external browser.  That button should only be as wide as the text, with borders, and centers.  All the changes to the files should appear together
