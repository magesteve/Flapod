The following question was used to generate source files for Flapod:

Please provide the complete Flutter app code for displaying NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using an API key that is read from the first line of a text file named key.txt located in the assets folder. The app should fetch and display the APOD image, with the title and date shown above the photo. If the APOD is a video, display the text 'Video available' and 'Click the View on NASA APOD button' (both in red and centered) above the day's information. If the data fails to load, display the message 'Unable to load image today' (in red and centered) instead of the usual information. The app should include a button to open the APOD page in an external browser and an FAQ button in the AppBar that reads questions and answers from an FAQ.txt file located in the assets folder. The FAQ dialog should be scrollable, and URLs within the FAQ text should be clickable, opening in an external browser. Make sure the image's width scales to fit the window's width, and ensure the app works well on macOS without any layout errors and supports scrolling. Please also provide the necessary pubspec.yaml file configuration to include both the key.txt and FAQ.txt files as assets.
